\section{Hybrid approach}
\label{sec:hybrid-approach}
Lets look at all the candidate traversal strategies before explaining and
reasoning our decision tree.

\subsection{Candidate traversal strategies}
\label{sec:candidate-traversals}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\textit{Depth-first search (DFS)}} traverses a CFG by starting at
a arbitary node as root and explores as far as possible along each branch before
backtracking.\newline
\item \textbf{\textit{Post order traversal (POS)}} traverses the vertices in the
order that they were last visited by the algorithm. In CFGs that does not
contain loops, post order guarantees that a node will be visited only after
visiting its successors.
\item \textbf{\textit{Reverse post order traversal (RPS)}} is the reverse of a
postordering, i.e. a list of the vertices in the opposite order of their last
visit. In CFGs that does not contain loops, reverse post order guarantees that a
node will be visited only after visiting its predecessors.
\item \textbf{\textit{Worklist approach}} starts off with all nodes in a
worklist. Then a node is removed from the worklist and processed. If the state
changes, then its successors (for forward dataflow problems) or predecessors
(for backward dataflow problems) are added to the worklist.  Another node is
taken from the worklist if one exists and the process repeats until the list is
empty. Worklist approach visits nodes only on demand and removes redundant visit
of nodes. Worklist approach has two types.
\begin{itemize}
\item Worklist with post ordering of nodes : In this strategy,  worklist is
initialized with post ordering of nodes.
\item Worklist with reverse post ordering of nodes : In this strategy,  worklist
is initialized with reverse post ordering of nodes.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{\textit{Random traversal (RAN)}} traverses a CFG in random order
of its nodes.
\end{itemize}
There are two other non-standard traversal strategies mentioned below which were
created due to the property of our CFG nodes.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\textit{Traversing in the increasing order of node ids (IN-ID)}}
This traversal visits nodes in the increasing order of their node ids. We have a
property associates with the nodes in the CFG called node id. Node ids are
assigned while constructing the CFG of the program. Node ids are assigned in a
topological order. For sequential graph, traversing the graph in the increasing
order of node ids will give the flow of the program from entry point to exit
point.

\item \textbf{\textit{Traversing in the decreasing order of node ids (DC-ID)}}
This traversal visits nodes in the decreasing order of their node ids. For
sequential graph, traversing the graph in the decreasing order of node ids will
give the backward flow of the program.
\end{itemize}

Let us reason the decisions taken by the decision tree and the optimizations
performed on it.
\subsection{Reasoning of the Decision tree}
\label{sec:Decision tree explained}
First, we check if the traversal is data flow sensitive or not. We distinguish
the traversal based on this property because traversal without data flow
completes in a single traversal of the CFG, while data flow sensitive traversal
traverses the CFG multiple time till all the nodes reach fixpoint ie the ouput
of all the nodes stabilizes. Hence the decision making process differs based on
the data flow  property. Lets look at the decision tree if the traversal is data
flow sensitive.\newline
\subsubsection{Decision tree for data flow sensitive traversal}
For data flow sensitive traversal, we look at the type of the control flow in
the CFG. This property is important now because the type of control flow
determines the number of traversal needed for data flow sensitive traversal.
\paragraph{Sequential CFG} \label{sec:decision-ds-seq}
If the graph is sequential, it means the CFG has no branches or loops. When we
know this property of graph, we can see that solving the data flow equations is
straightforward. Each node has only one predecessor/successor and hence if the
nodes are ordered in such a way that it is processed only after it's predecessor
(forward traversal) or it's successor (backward traversal), then the sequential
CFG will attain fix point in single traversal.
In order to get this ordering for sequential graph, we just have to traverse the
graph in the increasing of order of the CFG node ids (IN-ID) for forward
traversal and decreasing order of node ids (dc-id) for backward traversal. This
is because node ids are assigned in topological order as they are created and
for sequential graphs with no branches or loops, traversing the graph in the
increasing order of node ids will ensure that we traverse the node's predecessor
before the node itself. Traversing the graph in the decreasing order of node ids
will ensure that we traverse the node's successors before the node itself. Hence
hybrid traversal picks IN-ID for forward traversal and DC-ID for backward
traversal approach for sequential CFG. P-1 and P-2 in figure
\ref{fig:decision-tree} are the paths that lead to these decisions.\par
\textit{Optimization on the chosen traversal} : From the knowledge that the
graph is sequential and the traversal is data flow sensitive, hybrid approach
knows that IN-ID for forward traversal and DC-ID for backward traversal, will
complete the data flow sensitive traversal in first iteration of the CFG and we
do not have to check fixpoint in the first iteration to confirm it. Hence hybrid
approach removes fixpoint checking operation.\par

Approaches like DFS, POS, RPS, RAN will take two iteration to realize that we
have reached fix point in the first traversal, which is an overhead and an
unwanted traversal. WPOS and WRPS will visit only as much nodes as needed but it
will add an overhead of creating and maintaining the worklist. Also approaches
like DFS, POS, RPS involves accessing edge informations to determine the next
node to visit while IN-ID and DC-ID already has the nodes in order and just
visits them.\par

If the CFG is not sequential, then we check if the CFG has loops.
\paragraph{CFG with branches and no loop} \label{sec:decision-ds-br}
If the CFG does not have loop, then it is a CFG with branches and no loops. When
we know this property of graph, we can see that this CFG will stabilize in
single traversal if all predecessors of the node have been processed before the
node itself(for forward traversal) or if all the successors of the node have
been processed before the node itself(for backward traversal). RPS guarantees
such ordering for forward traversal and POS guarantees such ordering for
backward traversal. Hence hybrid picks RPS for forward traversal and POS for
backward traversal. P-9 and P-10 in figure \ref{fig:decision-tree} are the paths
that lead to these decisions.\par \textit{Optimization on the chosen traversal}
: From the knowledge that the graph has only branches and the traversal is data
flow sensitive, hybrid approach knows that RPS for forward traversal and POS for
backward traversal, will complete the data flow sensitive traversal in first
iteration of the CFG and will complete the data flow sensitive traversal in
first iteration of the CFG and we do not have to check fixpoint in the first
iteration to confirm it. Hence hybrid approach removes fixpoint checking
operation.\par Approaches like DFS, RAN, IN-ID, DC-ID will take multiple
iteration to reach fix point. WPOS and WRPS has an overhead of creating and
maintaining the worklist.

\paragraph{CFG with loops}
If the CFG has loops, it may or may not have branches other than the loop. We
next determine if the traversal is loop sensitive or not.\par \textbf{Loop
insensitive} : If the traversal is insensitive to loop, then we can just ignore
the loops present in the CFG and make decision based on the structure of the
rest of the CFG. If the CFG have branches other than the loop, then hybrid picks
RPS for forward traversal and POS for backward traversal based on the
explanation in Section \ref{sec:decision-ds-br}. P-5 and P-6 in figure
\ref{fig:decision-tree} are the paths that lead to these decisions. If the CFG
does not have branches other than the loop, then hybrid picks IN-ID for forward
traversal and DC-ID for backward traversal based on the explanation in Section
\ref{sec:decision-ds-seq}. P-7 and P-8 in figure \ref{fig:decision-tree} are the
paths that lead to these decisions.\par \textbf{Loop sensitive} : If the
traversal is loop sensitive and the CFG has loops, then no ordering of nodes can
guarantee fix point convergence in single traversal. Worklist approach is the
near best here as it visits node only on demand. Hybrid approach chooses WRPS
for forward traversal and WPOS for backward traversal. P-3 and P-4 in figure
\ref{fig:decision-tree} are the paths that lead to these decisions.\par
--------------discussion needed on why worklist is near best and not the
best-----------------\par Now let us look at the decision tree if the traversal
is data flow insensitive.
\subsubsection{Decision tree for data flow insensitive traversal}
% We check if the traversal is sensitive to the traversal strategy used.
% Traversal sensitivity means the output of the traversal changes from one
% traversal strategy to another. If the traversal is sensitive to the traversal
% strategy, then hybrid cannot pick the best strategy as we may compromise on
% the soundess of the result. We did not check this property when the traversal
% is data flow sensitive. This is because, even if data flow traversal is
% traversal sensitive, we will run the traversal till the fixpoint is reached
% and hence we will end up with the correct result.\par
If the traversal is data flow insensitive, then hybrid approach picks random
traversal. This is because since there is no data flow in the traversal, the
traversal is local to the node and is not dependent on the output of other nodes
and hence the nodes could be visited in any order.\par Other approaches like
DFS, POS, RPS involves accessing edge informations to determine the next node to
visit while WPOS and WRPS has an overhead of creating the worklist. IN-ID and
DC-ID has an unwanted contraint of accessing the nodes in order, which is an
overhead.\par Let us look at the algorithms that computes the required static
and dynamic properties.
